# ECE 470 Final Project: The Bartender
This repo contains the files to reproduce our final project for ECE 470, the Bartender. The robot is built and simulated like a bartender. The user can choose a choice with a user input. Then, the robot will be able to pick up bottles and pour them into the cup. The motions are done with both inverse kinematics and forward kinematics.
